To install chouwa, run the following command from the mercurial
repository::

    python setup.py install

This will install chouwa to the default location on your system. On an
Ubuntu system, this might be /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages. To
install to a different directory, supply setup.py with the ``--prefix``
option. For details, refer to the python setuptools documentation.

Alternatively, you can copy or symlink the ``chouwa`` subdirectory to a
directory on your python path. This facilitates updating through
mercurial.
